# React + Tailwind E-Commerce Website (Figma Recreation)

## Overview
This project is a **pixel-perfect recreation**(somewhat) of an e-commerce website design provided in Figma for my final project.  
The goal is to **replicate the original layout, spacing, and responsiveness** using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring the layout matches the provided design precisely.

At this stage, I’m focused on rebuilding the exact UI to match the Figma reference.  
Once the structure and responsiveness are complete, I will **develop my own unique brand identity** — including a new color system, logo, and brand story — once I settle on my creative inspiration.

## Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- PostCSS & Autoprefixer

##  Project Goals
- Achieve pixel-perfect layout accuracy from the provided Figma.
- Implement responsive design for all major breakpoints (SM, MD, LG).
- Later, rebrand and customize content with a unique creative theme.
