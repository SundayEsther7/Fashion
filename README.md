# React + Tailwind E-Commerce Website (Figma Recreation)

## Overview
This project is a **pixel-perfect recreation**(somewhat) of an e-commerce website design provided in Figma for my final project.  
The goal is to **replicate the original layout, spacing, and responsiveness** using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring the layout matches the provided design precisely.

At this stage, Iâ€™m focused on rebuilding the exact UI to match the Figma reference.  
Once the structure and responsiveness are complete, I will **develop my own unique brand identity** â€” including a new color system, logo, and brand story â€” once I settle on my creative inspiration.
